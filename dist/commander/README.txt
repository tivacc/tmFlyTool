================ Prerequisites for Simplicity Commander =====================

Simplicity Commander requires that the SEGGER J-Link software pack is
installed. This will normally be installed automatically by the
Simplicity Studio installer.

Alternatively, it can be downloaded from:
        
         https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html


============================ Using Custom Tokens ============================

Simplicity Commander supports defining custom token groups for reading
and writing. An example JSON token definition file and documentation
is provided as detailed for below for different operating systems.

Windows and Linux:
The "tokens" folder is included in the zip file and is placed
alongside the executable in the installation directory.

Mac OS X:
On Mac, the folder "~/Library/SimplicityCommander/tokens/" is
generated automatically when running commander on the command line for
the first time. Running "commander --help", for example, is enough to
ensure that the folder with files exist.
