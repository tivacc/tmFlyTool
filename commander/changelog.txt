==============================================================
Version 1.1.0
==============================================================

Added Features;
 * Added nvm3 command which supports reading NVM3 data from a device and parsing
   an image file containing NVM3 data
 * Added support for writing CRC32 to an image as a means of integrity check when
   not using Secure Boot.
 * Updated mbed TLS to 2.6.1
 * Updated JLlink DLL to 6.22d

Resolved Issues;
 * Writing an externally generated signature into an EBL file using
   "commander ebl create --signature" modified image stamp, which means that the
   previously generated signature was no longer valid.
   This did not affect cases where the image was also signed, i.e. secure boot.
 * When preparing an image for external signing for secure boot using
   "commander convert --secureboot --extsign", the signature type was not written to
   the application properties struct. This could lead to the bootloader treating the
   signed binary as if it was unsigned, i.e. rejecting it.
 * ECC token keys generated by "gbl keygen" were written with leading zeroes removed.
   This is not accepted by the token file parser, making them unusable.
 * Recovering from option byte failure on EM3xx using "device recover" did not work.
 * The die revision of Cortex-M0+ devices was not correctly read from the device

Known Issues/limitations;
 * Setting EBL timestamp and image info is not supported
 * There is no support for pretty-printing tokens yet (with type information etc)
 * There is no cross-checking of EUI vs certificates

==============================================================
Version 1.0.0
==============================================================

Added Features;
 * Added EM3xx support
 * Added support for MFG_THREAD_JOIN_KEY token

Resolved Issues;
 * In previous releases, when doing a partial write of a flash page, invalid data were
   occacionally written to areas of the page that should have remained unchanged.
   This issue occured due to a weakness in the read-modify-write process if the device
   was resetting itself during the flash read.
 * Device recovery did not work for some cases where the HF clock had been misconfigured
 * The legacy flashloader was used in case --halt or --noverify options were passed.
   Now Segger's flashloader is always used.
 * After flashing a device from the GUI, the debug interface was not always powered down.
   This could lead to the device not entering EM2 or EM3 before it was power cycled.

 * Setting EBL timestamp and image info is not supported
